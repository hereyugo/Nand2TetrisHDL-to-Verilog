# Nand2TetrisHDL-to-Verilog
A python program that translates the HDL from the Nand2Tetris course into Verilog. Useful if you want to take the logic gates you made in the course and apply them to an actual circuit board. Important Note: Don't leave any lines in the code empty until as the code encounters a bug (comments are fine).
