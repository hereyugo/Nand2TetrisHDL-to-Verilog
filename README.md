# Nand2TetrisHDL-to-Verilog
A python program that translates the HDL from the Nand2Tetris course into Verilog. Useful if you want to take the logic gates you made in the course and apply them to an actual circuit board. Important Note: Don't leave any lines in the code empty until as the code encounters a bug (comments are fine). The code to ignore comments and empty lines only ignores comments though I'm not sure why. If you do have an empty line in your NandHDL input, the program won't translate the Chip parts. The code mainly uses regular expressions to search and match different parts of the code. Made with AI assistance.
